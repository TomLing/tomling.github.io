# Tom Ling Personal Blog

## Intro

This is my personal blog built using dbyll http://dbtek.github.io/dbyll/ and jekyll https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.

## Install

* To stage the website you will need to install the gems for Bundler and Jekyll.

## Run

* Execute the following command in your terminal of choice - bundle exec jekyll serve.
* To use drafts (posts that you do not want to publish yet) use the --drafts switch.

## Update

* Run bundle update to update to the latest version of Jekyll.
