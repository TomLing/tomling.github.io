## Hi
- This is my personal blog built using dbyll http://dbtek.github.io/dbyll/ and jekyll https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.

##Install 

- To stage the website you will need to install the gems for Bundler and Jekyll
- Then run the following command - bundle exec jekyll serve
- To use drafts (posts that you do not want to publish yet) use the --drafts switch
